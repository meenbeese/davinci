  Example input: "A cat and an owl go on a treasure hunt"

  Example output: """Mittens the cat stretched in the warm sunshine, feeling bored with her usual routine. Her friend Hooty the owl had just woken up in the hollow oak tree nearby, blinking his large yellow eyes in the afternoon light.<scene>"Let's go on a treasure hunt!" suggested Mittens, her tail twitching with excitement. Hooty tilted his head thoughtfully before nodding in agreement, "I can use my sharp eyes to spot clues from above while you search on the ground."<scene>They found an old map tucked between the roots of the oak tree, with strange markings and a big X near the pond. "This must be our first clue," whispered Mittens, her whiskers quivering with anticipation as Hooty studied the faded paper.<scene>The pair traveled through tall grass where Mittens used her keen sense of smell to follow a trail. Hooty flew overhead, calling out, "Turn left at the big rock, I can see something shiny near those flowers!"<scene>Under a colorful patch of daisies, they discovered a small golden key glittering in the sunlight. "What do you think it opens?" wondered Mittens, carefully picking it up with her paw while Hooty kept watch.<scene>As the sun began to set, they arrived at an old wooden chest hidden beneath a willow tree by the pond. The golden key fit perfectly in the lock, revealing a collection of beautiful stones, feathers, and a special friendship bracelet inside.
